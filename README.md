# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

A supervised machine learning project that classifies breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project focuses on building a logistic regression model for early detection and diagnosis support.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: scikit-learn's built-in Breast Cancer dataset  
- **Samples**: 569  
- **Features**: 30 numeric features (e.g., mean radius, texture, smoothness)  
- **Target**: `Malignant` or `Benign`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform preprocessing and feature-target separation
3. Train/test split
4. Train logistic regression model
5. Evaluate model accuracy and predict on new data

## 📈 Results

- Training Accuracy: ~96%  
- Test Accuracy: ~94%  

> The model performs well on test data and can be enhanced further through hyperparameter tuning or alternative models.

## 🧪 Possible Enhancements

- Try SVM, KNN, or Random Forest for comparison  
- Add ROC curve and confusion matrix  
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV  
- Deploy as a basic Streamlit or Flask web app
